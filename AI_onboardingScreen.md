# Asset Data Structuring for AI & RAG

## Real Estate

**API Availability**  
Robust APIs like `Mashvisor`, `HouseCanary`, and `Finsire Real Estate Analyzer API` provide data on:

- Property value  
- Legal restrictions  
- Approval status  
- Resource availability  

**Recommended Fields for AI/RAG:**

```json
{
  "size": { "value": 5000, "unit": "sqft" },
  "is_cultivable": true,
  "legal_restrictions": "No construction allowed on 20% area",
  "development_approved": false,
  "purchase_date": "2020-06-15",
  "purchase_price": 1200000,
  "resource_availability": {
    "water": true,
    "minerals": "None",
    "utilities": "Electricity, Sewage",
    "transportation": "Highway nearby",
    "connectivity": "4G, Fiber Internet",
    "locality_type": "urban"
  }
}
```

## Gold

```json
{
  "purchase_date": "2021-01-10",
  "volume_g": 50.0,
  "purchase_price_per_g": 4700,
  "current_value": 5250
}
```

---

## Stocks

```json
{
  "ticker": "INFY",
  "unit_price_purchase": 1500,
  "units_bought": 10,
  "exchange_date": "2023-03-12"
}
```

---

## Vehicle, Crypto, Art & Collectibles

Follow a similar schema with strong-typed fields:

- **string** for IDs/names  
- **float** for prices/valuations  
- **date** for transactions  
- **Art-specific metadata**: `kind`, `initial_appraisal`, `last_appraiser_value`

---

> **Tip:**  
> A consistent schema enables RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and LLMs to query, retrieve, and reason over structured user data efficiently.

# Agentic AI-Compatible Conversational Frontend

## Efficient Onboarding Patterns

### Modular Stepwise Conversation

- Replace static forms with dynamic, multi-step flows.
- Use *callable actions* as user data changes.
- Store each interaction in **Firestore**/**BigQuery** in real time.
- Maintain a **live context** for AI querying.

---

## Contextual Prompts for Persona Discovery

Begin conversations with light, revealing questions to infer lifestyle and risk profiles:

- _“If you unexpectedly received ₹50,000, would you save it, invest it, or spend it on something special?”_  
- _“Have you set any financial goals for the next year? (travel, buy a car/house, investments)”_  
- _“When it comes to tracking your spending, would you say you’re meticulous, casual, or spontaneous?”_  

Use responses to infer personas like `Saver`, `Investor`, `Adventurer`, `Spontaneous Spender` using logic or LLM.

## Adaptive UI via AI

Flutter widget with a dynamic `question+context` array.

Each question object contains:

```json
{
  "id": "q1",
  "prompt": "What is your monthly income?",
  "expected_type": "float",
  "follow_ups": [
    { "condition": "income > 100000", "next": "q2_high" },
    { "condition": "income <= 100000", "next": "q2_low" }
  ]
}
```

- Each answer is sent to the backend.
- AI agent evaluates the **next best question** or **navigates to a new segment**.

## Best Practices for Agentic AI Frontend Onboarding

### Personalization  
Leverage existing user metadata (city, bank, prior answers) to generate intuitive onboarding questions.

### Explainability  
Show AI-inferred persona summaries:  
> _“Based on your answers, you seem to value stability and planning. We’ll suggest options tailored to ‘Budgetor’ profiles.”_

### RAG-enabled Memory  
Allow agents to retrieve past answers:  
> _“You mentioned buying gold last year, so here are some tips for asset diversification.”_

### Conversational Transitions  
Users should be able to revisit/edit answers. Agent should adapt flow based on edits.

# Sample Persona Questions (AI Prompts)

- “What’s your biggest financial goal this year?”
- “Do you prefer a simple overview of your money or deep, detailed breakdowns?”
- “When making big spending decisions, do you consult anyone, research a lot, or go with your gut?”
- “How often do you like to check your account balances?”
- “Have you invested in any assets before (real estate, stocks, gold, crypto, art)? Which was your favorite?”

Agent uses responses to assign personas like:

- `Budgetor`  
- `Investor`  
- `Explorer`  
- `Maximizer`

…and tailors the app experience accordingly.

# Implementation Suggestion

- Implement all onboarding questions and asset schemas using **dynamic, schema-driven JSON**.
- Let **Gemini-powered agent** parse, infer, and enhance inputs at runtime.
- Use **RAG** to surface previously ingested context for coaching and clarifications.
- Enable the LLM to suggest clarifications, tips, and prompt users for more data.
