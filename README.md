# Walleterium Imperium - Agentic AI Money Manager App
LLM + RAG + Tools Approach Using Only Google Products

## Module 1: User & Account Management
## Sub-Module 1.1: AI-Powered Interactive Onboarding

- Tech: Google Identity Platform (Firebase Authentication, Google Identity Services)
- Secure user onboarding, Single Sign-On (SSO), social logins.
- AI onboarding powered by Gemini (via Vertex AI) for conversational, interactive setup.

### User Profile & Settings:

- Store and manage profiles using Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.

## Module 2: Data Persistence Layer (The Database)
- Tech: Google Cloud Firestore or BigQuery (for analytics-heavy workloads).
- Secure, scalable document and analytical data storage.
- Integrates natively with Firebase and Google Cloud services.

## Module 3: Core Backend Services & APIs
### Tech: Google Cloud Functions & Google Cloud Run.
### Serverless functions for business logic and APIs.
### Use Vertex AI for Gemini LLM inference and reasoning.
### API Gateway for secure endpoints.

## Module 4: Google Wallet Integration Layer
- Tech: Google Wallet API (Google Pay API).
- Integration for transaction data, payment management, and digital cards.
- Use OAuth2 and secure token management via Google Cloud.

## Module 5: Multi-Modal Data Ingestion & Enrichment
- Tech:
- Google Cloud Dataflow for ETL workflows (bank statements, receipts, etc.)
- Cloud Vision AI for OCR on receipts/documents.
- Pub/Sub for ingesting streaming financial data.
- BigQuery ML or Vertex AI for enrichment/annotation.

## Module 6: Gemini-Powered Coaching & Reasoning Core
### Sub-Module 6.1: Persona-Driven AI Engine
- Custom personas built and managed via Vertex AI Prompt Management.
- Store persistent persona state in Firestore.
### Sub-Module 6.2: Contextual Query Engine
- RAG flow: Embed and index user data in Vertex AI Matching Engine.
- Retrieve personalized context for Gemini’s LLM API to power fine-tuned, context-aware responses.
### Sub-Module 6.3: Proactive & Predictive Intelligence Engine
- Use BigQuery ML or Vertex AI for predictive analytics (e.g., expense forecast, budgeting).
- Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Tasks for periodic, proactive nudges, alerts, summaries.
## Module 7: Gamified Presentation & Action Layer
- Tech:
- Flutter (for multi-platform app) or Web (Flutter Web/AngularDart with Google Material).
- Integrate with Google Play Games Services for achievements and leaderboards.
- Use Google Analytics/Firebase Analytics for tracking gamification effects.
- Google’s Dialogflow CX for conversational UIs.
## Cross-Cutting Agentic AI Approach
### Everything orchestrated by a Gemini (LLM) agent:
- Main reasoning/planning loop through Vertex AI Gemini LLM.
- Dynamic RAG: Pull recent/personalized data from Firestore/BigQuery using Vertex AI’s Matching Engine.
- Tools as “skills” (function-calling to backend endpoints, reading/writing to DB, invoking Google Wallet API, etc.).
- Proactive suggestions using scheduled Gemini calls with up-to-date context.

### Example Flow (Signup & Recommendation):
- User opens app; SSO via Google.
- Gemini LLM (Vertex AI) interacts with user for onboarding, using persona management and past context.
- User uploads bank statements (Google Cloud Dataflow, OCR via Vision, parsing into Firestore).
- Gemini agent ingests enriched data, suggests personalized spending goals via reasoning over RAG-retrieved user data.
- Budgeting progress and gamification presented in Flutter app, updates via Cloud Functions.
- All financial nudges/predictions powered by BigQuery ML/Vertex AI, delivered proactively.

### Why This Approach is Agentic & Google-Native
- Agentic: The Gemini LLM acts autonomously, proactively, and contextually; it chooses tools, fetches data (RAG), and calls Google APIs as needed.
- Fully Google Stack: Identity, cloud, AI, analytics, auth, presentation—all Google products.
- Scalable & Secure: Leverages Google Cloud's infrastructure for compliance and reliability.
